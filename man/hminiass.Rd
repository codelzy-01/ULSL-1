\title{Hungarian Algorithm for Optimal Assignment}
\usage{
hminiass(A)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{A numeric matrix representing the cost matrix.
Negative values indicate potential matches between rows and columns.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{A}{The updated cost matrix after performing the assignment process.}
\item{C}{An integer vector of length equal to the number of columns in A,
indicating the row index assigned to each column. A value of 0
means the column is unassigned.}
\item{U}{An integer vector containing the indices of unassigned rows,
with the first element reserved as a placeholder.}
}
}
\description{
Implements a variant of the Hungarian algorithm to find an optimal assignment
in a cost matrix. This is often used for problems such as label matching,
where one needs to align two sets of labels with minimal cost.
The function returns the updated cost matrix, the assignment vector,
and a list of unassigned rows.
