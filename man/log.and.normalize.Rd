\title{Log-transform and normalize multi-omics data}
\usage{
\method{log}{and.normalize}(omics.data, normalize = TRUE, log.transform = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{omics.data}{A list of omics datasets. Each element should be a numeric
matrix with features in rows and samples in columns.}

\item{normalize}{Logical or logical vector. If a single value, it is recycled
to all views. If a vector, its length must match the number of datasets.
Indicates whether to apply normalization to each dataset.}

\item{log.transform}{Logical or logical vector. If a single value, it is
recycled to all views. If a vector, its length must match the number of
datasets. Indicates whether to apply \code{log(1+x)} transformation
to each dataset.}
}
\value{
A list of processed omics datasets with the same structure as
the input \code{omics.data}.
}
\description{
This function performs optional log-transformation and normalization
on a list of omics datasets. Each dataset is assumed to be a matrix
with rows representing features (e.g., genes) and columns representing samples.
}
\details{
The function includes three main preprocessing steps:
\enumerate{
\item Remove features with zero variance.
\item Apply \code{log(1+x)} transformation (optional).
\item Normalize each dataset (optional).
}
}
